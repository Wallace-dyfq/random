# Creep in crystalline metals + ceremics
- for creep to be significant, temperature has to be greater than:
   + most metal: T > 0.3 T_m (\deg K)
   + creep resistant alloys: T > 0.5 T_m (\deg K)
   + ceramics: T > 0.5 T_m (\deg K)
- creep strain depends on stress, temperature
- at \sigma < \sigma_y, at high enough temperatures, under constant
  \sigma, \epsilon increases with time


# Types of creep
- primary creep
- second creep: diffuisonal flow, power law creep
- tertiary creep

# Secodary Creep
- consider relative magnitude of creep from diffusional flow + power
law creep:
  + at low stress, contribution of diffusional flow to creep can be
    significant
  + at high stress, power law creep dominates creep response
## Difusional flow
- steady state strain rate linearly dependent on stress
- diffusional flow is important at low stress + high temperature

## Power law creep
- steady state strain rate depends non-linearly on stress
- high stress + high temperature

# Design for creep
have to consider
- total creep strain less than allowable strain for component to fit
  together
- creep strain to failure is adequate to cope with allowable strain
- time to failure longer than design life

# Measurement of creep parameters
- dead load specimens in a furnace at constant stress and constant
  temperature
- measure strain with respect to time
- in one series of tests, hold stress constant and vary temperature T
- in another series of tests, hold temperature constant and vary
  stress

# Mechanicsm of creep: diffusion
- creep in crystalline metals + ceremics causes by diffusion
- different diffusion paths at work in diffusional flow and power law
- diffusional flow: bulk diffusion + grain boundary diffusion
- power law creep: dislocation climb
- diffusion can be driven by a mechanical force

## Diffusional flow

### Bulk diffusion
- vacancy diffusion, diffusion to a vacancy site

### Grain boundary diffusion
- grain boundary is a region of disorder where differently oriented
  crystals meet
- more open structure that rest of crystal

## Grain boundary diffusion
- boundary acts like a high conductivity channel
- contribution to diffusive transport depends on how much grain
  boundary available, relative to size of grain
  


# Mechanism of power law creep: dislocation climb
- alloying elements are abstacles to dislocation glide
- diffusion can allow dislocation to "climb" around obstacles +
  continuous glide
 - consider dislocation hitting obatacle (eg. precipate) at \sigma = \sigma_y

# Power law creep: dislocation climb
- dislocation can "climbs" around an obstacle and continue to glide
until it hits the next obstacle: process of climb + glide repeated.
- power law creep data
# Deformation mechanism map
- various mechanism of deformation
  + elastic
  + plastic
  + creep - diffusional flow - bulk (vacancy) diffusion
                             - grain boundary diffusion
          - power law creep  - low temp: core diffusion
                             - high temp: bulk diffusion
- over all behavior summarized in deformation mechanism map
- plasticity + creep depends on equivalent stress

# Creep fracture
- secondary creep important if design limited by creep strain
- also have to consider creep fracture
- caused by coalescance of voids caused by diffusion material leaves
  inclined boundaries to be deposited on horizontal areas
- empirical relation: Monkman-Grant equation

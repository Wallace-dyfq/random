# Fracture
* Materials may fail by brittle fracture
* Material have cracks in them
* under critical consition, crack propagate -> fracture
* examples: WWII Liberty Ship

## Griffith crack theory
* consider an infinite plate, containing a crack, stressed in tension
  to some fixed displacement
* if the crack grows by \delta a, the stress relaxes and the strain
  energy decreases
* roughly estimate the changes in strain energy in going from no crack
  to crack of length a
* or, if crack grow by \delta a
* surface energy required for a increase in crack length by \delta a
  is ?
* define energy absorbed per unit area of crack
* equating work done in forming new surface with strain energy
  reequired
* this analysis is approaximate, stress not constant at crack tip,
  relaxed area not semicircle
* exact analysis requires stress distribution ahead of crack tip
* Griffith criterion is valid only if plastic zone small

## Plastic zone size

## Measurement of fracture toughness
* plastic zone size larger for plane stress than plane strain
* K_c larger for plane stress than plane strain
* want to measure lowest K_c ( to be conservative), "plane strain
  fracture toughness"
* plane stress: thin speciman
* plane strain: thick speciman
* various geometries used for fracture toughness tests

## Micromechanisms of fast fracture
* ceramics + glasses: brittle, cracks propagate easily
* Matals typically ductile - resistant to crack propagate, but can
  become brittle at low temperature
* polymers - intermediate, and can be made tougher by making them into
  composite

## Mechanism of crack propagation: cleavage
* fracture surface of ceramic or glass - smooth
* featureless flat surface, with little or no plastic deformation
* ceramics + glasses have high yield strength
* local stress breaks apart interatomic bonds
* crack propaagte by separating a pair of atomic plane, giving rise to
  atomically flat surface by cleavage

## Mechanisms of crack propagation: ductile tearing
* facture surface of cracked ductile metal that has fracture is rough
* a lot of plastic work taken place to form rough surface
* plastic zone at crack tip
* soft metals have low yield stress, large plastic zone size
* hard ceramics have high yield stress, small plastic zone size

## Ductile tearing
* even when nominally pure, most metals contain small inclusions of
  chemical component formed by reaction of metals + impurify atoms
* within plastic zone, plastic flow takes place around these
  inclusions, leading to elongated cavities
* as plastic flow progresses, cavities link up, turning a sharp crack
  into a blunt one. reducing the stress concentration
* ductile tearing consumes a lot of energy by plastic flow, increasing
* explain why ductile metals so tough

## Ductile to brittle transition
* Whether or not behavior is ductile or brittle depends on yield
  strength and size of plastic zone
* yield stress depends on temperature and strain rate
* as temperature T decreases, yield strength increases, plastic zone
  size decreases
* as temperature T decreases, material becomes more brittle
* get ductile-brittle transition as temperature decreases ( or as
  strain rate increases)

## Composite
* composite can be much more resistant to crack propagation (much
  tougher) than their constituents
*  e.q., glass fibers in epoxy resin; glass, epoxy both brittle
* but composite is much tougher
* fibers act as crack stoppers
* as crack reaches fiber, it can debond, blunting the crack +
  arresting the crack
* rubber toughened epoxy
  + rubber particles act like little springs, clanping the crack
    closed again
  + increass load needed to prepagate crack
  + increase toughness

# Fatigue
* repeated stress cycles can cause failure at stresses less than the
  ultimate tensile strength, or even the yield strength

## Fatigue of uncracked component
* non pre-existing crack
* e.g., small component - gear teeth
* fracture controlled by initiation of crack

### Empirical relations for uncracked component
* if \delta \sigma varies over lifetime of component, then sum the
  damage for each \delta \sigma

## Fatigue of cracked component
* pre-existing crack
* large structure e..g, bridge, ships, pressure vassels
* fracture controlled by propagation of crack
* cycclically load specimen with sharp crack

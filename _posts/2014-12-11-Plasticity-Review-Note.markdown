# Plasticity: assumptions
- plastic flow occurs at constant volume
- plasticity associated with dislocation motion
- one block of material slips over another
- true for fully dense solid
- not true for celluar materials
- material is isotropic

# Yield criteria
- Various theories developed:
   + Rankine (1857): Maximum stress criterion, yield when maximum principle stress equals to yield strength
   + Tresca (1864, 1867): Maximum shear stress criterion, yield when maximum shear stress in component equals to maximum shear stress in uniaxial test at yield
   + von Mises (1913): Maximum distortional energy criterion, yield when equivalent stress equals yield stress in a uniaxial test

# Dislocations

## Geometric aspects: 
- dislocation is a line defect in the stacking of atoms in crystal lattice
- most dislocations are mixed, part edge, part screw
- Burgur's vector of dislocation cannot change
- dislocation line cannot terminate within a crystal
- dislocation line can only terminate at a surface of a surface, e.g., free surface or grain boundary
- dislocation can form closed loops
				  

## Edge dislocation
- extra half plane of atoms in one part of crystal structure
- Burger's vector perpendicular to the vector parallel to dislocation line

## Screw dislocation
- two blocks of material sheared acorss partial cut through material
- Burger's vector parallel to the vector parallel to dislocation line

## Dislocation motion

### Glide
- dislocation moves in the surface that contains both its line and Burger's vector
- results in slip - sliding of one plane of atoms over another on slip planes
- under shear stress, bonds sequentially break  reform so that dislocation moves through the lattice until it leaves at the surface
- net result is slip step of one atomic distance
- slip planes - most densely packed planes
- slip direction - direction in the slip plane in which atoms are most closely ?????

### Climb
- dislocation moves out of glide surface
- requires diffusion - thermally activated process
- discuss in section on high temp creep in metal + ceremics

### Kinks + Jogs
- if a section of dislocation glides as the slip plane, it acquires kinks
- if a section of dislocation climbs out of the slip plane onto another, parallel split plane, it acquire jogs
